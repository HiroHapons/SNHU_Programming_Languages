# SNHU_Programming_Languages
These are all the projects that I have done in C++ wjhile undergoing the programming languages course provided by SNHU

Project 1: Dual Clock System (Chada Tech Interview)

This project created two synchronized 12-hour and 24-hour clocks in C++ to meet ISO 8601 standards, solving the problem of displaying time for international users. I did well in applying OOP principles and ensuring accurate time synchronization. Future improvements could include exception handling and real-time updates for efficiency and user experience. The hardest part was linking both clocks to a single time source, which I solved by centralizing the logic in one class. I used C++ documentation and zyBooks for reference. This project strengthened my OOP and input-handling skills. I maintained readability with consistent naming, modular functions, and in-line comments.

Project 2: Airgead Banking Investment Calculator

This project simulated investment growth using compound interest to teach financial responsibility. I implemented accurate financial formulas and clear output formatting. I could enhance the program by separating logic from display and adding file I/O, improving modularity and scalability. The most challenging part was handling compound interest calculations, which I solved by testing smaller code sections. I used online C++ references to verify logic. Transferable skills include algorithm design and clean coding practices. I ensured maintainability through proper naming conventions, structured code, and helpful comments.

Project 3: Corner Grocer Item Tracker

This program analyzed text records to count and visualize item purchase frequency, helping optimize store layout. I performed well using maps for efficient data tracking and implemented file backups for persistence. Enhancements could include better exception handling and flexible data input, increasing robustness and adaptability. The toughest part was managing file I/O and iterators, which I solved by reviewing C++ file stream examples and testing iteratively. I added official C++ documentation and coding forums to my resource network. I gained transferable experience in data structures and file management. Readability and maintainability were achieved through modular functions, comments, and clear naming.
